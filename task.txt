Test Tasks - 


1. Create C# server side code to return the above data model to the page - add some sample data of categories and sub categories with at least 3 levels (to clarify - the hard coded data is just sample - while the code should support unlimited subcategories level, and by levels I mean each subcategory can have another subcategory inside and on on and on)


data for example (its s short example - more data is needed to create 3 levels)


[

{

    CategoryId = 1,

},

{

    CategoryId = 2,

    CategoryName = "Apples",

    ParentCategoryId = 1

}
